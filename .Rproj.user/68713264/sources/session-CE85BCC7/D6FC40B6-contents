## Description of data and data source

*Describe what the data is, what it contains, where it is from, etc.
Eventually this might be part of a methods section.*

The data source used for this project is the National Health Interview
Survey (NHIS.) It is a harmonized set of data beginning in 1963 with
information on general health status, acute and chronic illness,
functional limitations, access to care, insurance coverage, and health
behaviors for the U.S. population. On average, the survey covers 100,000
persons in 45,000 households each year. PUMS NHIS currently contains
over 17,000 integrated variables from 1963 to present.

As the outcome of interest, researchers will focus on those who, in this
household survey between the years of 2012 and 2021, answered no when
they were asked whether they had ANY flu vaccine in the past 12 months.

Possible variables to be assessed are as follows: 1. Demographics: age,
sex, race, ethnicity, veteran status 2. Socio-economic status: education
level, total combined family income, employment status, paid sick leave
as part of job benefits, ratio of family income to poverty threshold 3.
General health: perceived health status, categorical BMI Conditions:
ever told had asthma, ever told had cancer, ever told had coronary heart
disease 4. COVID-19: had COVID-19 according to test 5. Health behaviors:
alcohol drinking status, cigarette smoking status Access to care: has
usual place for medical care, medical care delayed due to cost (past 12
months) 6. Health insurance: health insurance coverage status 7. Mental
health: anxiety level, depression level

## Questions/Hypotheses to be addressed

<<<<<<< HEAD
*State the research questions you plan to answer with this analysis.*

Using the aforementioned database, our research question of interest is
as follows: which groups are at highest risk for low uptake of flu
vaccine?

# Methods

*Describe your methods. That should describe the data, the cleaning
processes, and the analysis approaches. You might want to provide a
shorter description here and all the details in the supplement.*

## Data aquisition

<<<<<<< HEAD
*As applicable, explain where and how you got the data. If you directly
import the data from an online source, you can combine this section with
the next.*

## Data import and cleaning

<<<<<<< HEAD
*Write code that reads in the file and cleans it so it's ready for
analysis. Since this will be fairly long code for most datasets, it
might be a good idea to have it in one or several R scripts. If that is
the case, explain here briefly what kind of cleaning/processing you do,
and provide more details and well documented code somewhere (e.g. as
supplement in a paper). All materials, including files that contain
code, should be commented well so everyone can follow along.*

# Results

## Exploratory/Descriptive analysis

<<<<<<< HEAD
*Use a combination of text/tables/figures to explore and describe your
data. Show the most important descriptive results here. Additional ones
should go in the supplement. Even more can be in the R and Quarto files
that are part of your project.*

## Basic statistical analysis

<<<<<<< HEAD
*To get some further insight into your data, if reasonable you could
compute simple statistics (e.g. simple models with 1 predictor) to look
for associations between your outcome(s) and each individual predictor
variable. Though note that unless you pre-specified the outcome and main
exposure, any "p\<0.05 means statistical significance" interpretation is
not valid.* To be completed in future

## Full analysis

*Use one or several suitable statistical/machine learning methods to
analyze your data and to produce meaningful figures, tables, etc. This
might again be code that is best placed in one or several separate R
scripts that need to be well documented. You want the code to produce
figures and data ready for display as tables, and save those. Then you
load them here.*
