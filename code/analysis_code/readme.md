This folder contains code to do some analysis on the processed/cleaned data.

There is a Quarto file which does some exploratory data analysis by creating a few tables and figures.

There will also be another Quarto file in the future with our extended analysis and statistical model fitting. 
An R script does some simple statistical model fitting.
